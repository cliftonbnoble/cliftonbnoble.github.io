            <strong>Welcome to my page!</strong>  My name is Clifton Noble and I’m trying to learn how to code.  The goal is to become a full stack developer and build fun things.  I’ve always been interested in doing more development so I decided to enroll in this class.  So far I’m really enjoying it and I’m optimistic about the remaining weeks.
            </p>
            <p>I currently work in IT as an Application Programmer for the City of Berkeley where I support applications for public safety and work to bring in new technology.  Occasionally I will be asked to do a little scripting or development but would like to do more.</p>
            <p>In my free time I like to play and watch basketball.  My favorite team is the Warriors and I’ve been a fan since Chris Webber when they were awful - I didn’t just recently jump on the bandwagon.  I also enjoy being active and doing things outdoors.  Surfing and snowboarding are two of my favorite outdoor activities.  I’m not a great surfer but being bad at surfing is still a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>I grew up in the bay area.  I went to high school and college here.  I currently live in Berkeley in with my wife and dog.</p>
