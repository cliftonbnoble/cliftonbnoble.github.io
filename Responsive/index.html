      <p><strong>Welcome to my page!</strong> My name is Clifton Noble and I’m trying to learn how to code. The goal is to become a full stack developer and build fun things. I’ve always been interested in doing more development so I decided to enroll in this class. So far I’m really enjoying it and I’m optimistic about the remaining weeks.</p>

      <p>I currently work in IT as an Application Programmer for the City of Berkeley where I support applications for public safety and work to bring in new technology. Occasionally I will be asked to do a little scripting or development but would like to do more.</p>

      <p>In my free time I like to play and watch basketball. My favorite team is the Warriors and I’ve been a fan since Chris Webber when they were awful - I didn’t just recently jump on the bandwagon. I also enjoy being active and doing things outdoors. Surfing and snowboarding are two of my favorite outdoor activities. I’m not a great surfer but being bad at surfing is still a lot of fun.</p>
